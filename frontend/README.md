# Trivy UI Frontend

This is the frontend for Trivy UI, a web application that provides an interactive interface for viewing and analyzing vulnerability reports generated by Trivy. It is built using Vite, React, and TypeScript, and communicates with a FastAPI backend that exposes Trivy report data.

## Features

- Interactive pie chart for severity distribution
- Filtering by:
  - Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Unknown)
  - Package name
  - Vulnerability ID (CVE)
- Sorting support for severity, package name, CVE ID, and target
- Client-side pagination with customizable page size
- CVE ID linking to cve.org for additional context
- Light and dark theme compatibility
- State is persisted in the URL to allow sharing filtered report views

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher recommended)
- The Trivy UI backend server running on the default `/api` path

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running in Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

## Project Structure

```plaintext
src/
├── components/
│   └── ReportDetail.tsx      - Main report analysis interface
├── App.tsx                   - Main route definitions
├── main.tsx                  - React root rendering
├── index.css                 - Global styles (Tailwind)
```

## Customization

You can modify the following behavior via the URL parameters:

- `severity` (multi-value): Filters by selected severity levels
- `pkgName`: Filters by package name substring
- `vulnId`: Filters by CVE substring
- `page`: Sets the current pagination page
- `pageSize`: Sets number of rows displayed per page

Example:

```
/report/1234?severity=CRITICAL&severity=HIGH&pkgName=openssl&page=1&pageSize=15
```
